similarcolor test


We start with the image "White House at Night" by Vincent Van Gogh, which has a good use of dynamic color spaces:

The script will download the file if it's not there


Then we add permute a few variations

 * brightness
 * contrast
 * rotation
 * color balance
 * blur
 * sharpness
 * crop
 * resize
 * compression

And show how this passes the same image threshhold.
